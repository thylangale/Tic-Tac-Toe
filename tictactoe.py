    Given a list representing the state of the board

    the user clicked, update the board
    with an O in the corresponding position. Your
    code will need to translate the screen coordinate
    (a pixel position where the user clicked) into the
    corresponding board position (a value between 0 and
    8 inclusive, identifying one of the 9 board positions).
    The function returns a bool indicated if
    the operation was successful: if the user
    clicks on a position that is already occupied
    or outside of the board area, the move is
    invalid, and the function should return False,

    game has reached a stalemate, achieved when
    the board is full and no further move is possible.
    If there is a winner or if there is a stalemante, display
    an appropriate message to the user and clear the board

    position. The algorithm for selecting the
    computer's move shall be as follows: if it is
    possible for the computer to win in one move,
    it must do so. If the human player is able 
    to win in the next move, the computer must
    try to block it. Otherwise, the computer's
